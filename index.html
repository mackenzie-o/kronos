                    <h2>Time Dilation</h2>
                    <p style="font-style: italic;">def. The difference of elapsed time between two events as measured by observers either moving relative to each other or differently situated from a gravitational mass.</p>

                    <p>In other words, time dilation is the difference in the amount of time experienced between two locations. This occurs when one party is moving faster (relative velocity time dilation) or is closer to an object of mass (gravitational time dilation). The faster the velocity difference between the two parties or the closer one party is to an object of mass, the more extreme effects of time dilation are.</p> 

                    <p>Relative velocity time dilation was predicted by Einstein's special theory of relativity in 1905. Gravitational time dilation was predicted by the general theory of relativity put forward by Einstein 10 years later. Time dilation has been measured in a variety of tests; many  involve utilizing highly accurate atomic clocks or observing the lifespan of particles under different conditions. The effects of relative velocity and gravitational time dilation can combine, and systems like GPS must account for both to maintain accuracy. </p>

                            <p><b>While conversations about time dilation frequently revolve around long-distance space travel and black holes, its effects can be measured (in small amounts) on Earth.</b> In 2010, time dilation was observed between atomic clocks at speeds less than 10 meters/second and hight differences of only one meter. You experience time dilation on the scale of nanoseconds when flying in commercial airplanes, experiencing more time relative to someone on the ground when flying west, and less time when flying east. {And if you are committed staying young, you could constantly move at a speed of {????} at sea level, and after {???} years you would be {???? units} younger than someone born at the same time.}<br/>

                            <h2>Misconception #2: <br/> Time Dilation Makes Time Feel Slower</h2>
                            <br/>
                            <p><b>Time always feels as though it is passing normally, despite the effect of time dilation, because time dilation affects our internal clock.</b> If you were to fall towards a black hole, time would feel exactly as it did before, until the extreme gravity kills you. An observer far away from the black hole, however, would see you gradually slow as you approach the black hole. To both you and the observer time feels normal, but seconds for you near the black hole are equivalent to many years for the observer.

                            <br/>
                            <p><b>Time dilation does not allow us to travel back in time, but it does allow for a form of forward time travel.</b> Sorry Marty McFly and Superman, the affects of time dilation can be used to make you younger or older than than your peers, but you can't rewind time. Astronauts age slower than their earthbound counterparts due to the speed of the space station, but they'll never return younger than when they left, just younger than they otherwise would have been on earth. Sergei Krikalev, Russian cosmonaut, is the current time travel record holder. Having spent 803 days in space, he has lost 0.2 seconds.

                    <h3>The Radical Creativity Course</h3>
                    <p>Radical Creativity is a new Honors College Seminar that aims to enable students to explore and enhance their creativity through the artistic communication of complex and abstract scientific concepts. The course is co-taught by Associate Professor Sara Mast, School of Art, Assistant Professor Nicolas Yunes, Physics Department, and Adjunct Instructor Jessica Jellison, School of Architecture. The course was inspired by a previous collaboration by the faculty, entitled <a href="www.blackwhole.montana.edu">Black (W)hole</a>.</p>
                    <p>Students were divided into small groups, each made up of half students from the sciences and engineering, and half students from the arts. Each group was then tasked to identify a physics concept to explain through artistic means to the public, culminating in an art installation.</p>
                    <p>All Radical Creativity installations will be open to the public during our class Art Walk on <b>Monday, December 12th, 6-8pm</b>. See link below for more information.</p>

                    <h3>The Kronos Installation</h3>
                    <p><b>The Topic:</b> We chose to tackle time dilation as a topic because, while frequently touched on in movies and science fiction, it is frequently misunderstood. And while time dilation may feel to many to be a distant phenomena, it's actually fairly close to home, affecting everyday systems like GPS. Time dilation also hasn't been tackled fairly often by the artscience community (the only notable exception we found was <a href="http://chomkorosier.com/space-clocks.php">"The Relative Clocks"</a>) so we'd have a chance to portray time dilation in a new and unique way.</p>
                    <p><b>The Execution:</b> The format we finally settled on was a dance piece, centering around a sphere, representing a large mass. As the dancer circled the sphere, the music would slow, indicating the slowness of the dancer's time relative to the audience's as she enters the sphere's gravity well. Throughout the piece, a heartbeat remains steady to remind the audience that time always feels the same to dancer.</p>
                    <p>The sphere is made out of aluminum tubing and wire and wrapped with electrical tape. At a little over 6ft in diameter, it is roughly the size of Jupiter if it were to collapse into a black hole. The sound piece is a modified Bach Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major, which was chosen due to its recognizability, structure, and the fact that the piece already features a lot of manipulation of time on the part of the musician.</p>
                    <p><b>The Site:</b> Throughout the process, multiple prototyping sites were made to play with different ideas. You can see two iterations <a href="./v1/index.html">here</a> and <a href="./v2/index.html">here</a>. The current iteration of the site is designed to provide some background information on the installation and further explanation of time dilation. The code for the site is available below.</p>
